# Chess Bot – Mimicking My Playstyle ♟️🤖

This project is a custom-built **chess bot designed to mimic my personal playing style** rather than playing purely optimal or engine-based moves.

Unlike traditional chess engines that aim only for the best possible move, this bot focuses on **replicating human-like decision-making**, move preferences, and patterns observed in my own games.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
- To study my own chess playing patterns
- To build a bot that plays *like me*, not like Stockfish
- To explore AI logic, heuristics, and decision-making in games
- To combine chess knowledge with programming concepts

---

## 🧠 How It Works (High-Level)
- My past chess games were analyzed
- Move patterns, openings, and preferences were extracted
- The bot evaluates positions based on learned tendencies
- Instead of always choosing the strongest engine move, it selects moves aligned with my style

*(Exact implementation details may vary as the project evolves.)*

---

## 🚀 Features
- Mimics my personal chess playstyle
- Produces human-like moves
- Supports standard chess rules
- Can be extended with stronger evaluation logic or ML models
- Modular and easy to improve
